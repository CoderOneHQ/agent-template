# üêâ Dungeons and Data Structures - Agent Templates
This Repo contains templates and practise Agents for the AI Sports Challenge 2020 (Dungeons and Data Structures).

Download the Agent file and save this in your working directory for the challenge.

**Agents**:
- `my_agent.py`: a template file to help you get started with your first Agent
- `wanderer.py`: a bot that wanders aimlessly around the map
- `stand_still.py`: a bot that thinks for 1s and does nothing
- `random_agent.py`: a bot that makes random moves
- `flee_bot.py`: a bot that places bombs and runs away

For full documentation on how to create your Agent, check out the resources [here](https://bit.ly/aisportschallenge). (Resources available from 11 Dec 5PM AEST)
